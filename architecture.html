		    			If you are planning to build, remodel, re-roof or paint the exterior of your chalet you must submit your plans and receive approval from the Architectural Control Committee prior to beginning work. This approval is in addition to any other permits or approvals required by King County or any other jurisdiction that applies. This committee consists of two members appointed by the board of trustees to uphold the building restrictions as outlined in the Community Club Covenants. For additional information on building requirements and restrictions please refer to the Alpental Community Club Inc. Covenants and Bylaws.
