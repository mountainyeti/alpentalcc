							We recently had a change of Treasurers for the Alpental Community Club.  For those who may have missed the announcement, David Harja has replaced Bob Ilgenfritz for this position.  During this transition, many changes have been made to streamline the operations and make payments safer for our members.  We have upgraded our accounting software to QuickBooks online.  We have created a dedicated ACC post office box located in North Bend to help keep payments secure.  We have performed a thorough audit of all member accounts and made billing corrections when needed to bring accounts current.  We have utilized the email feature of the QuickBooks program to make billing faster and easier while saving money on postage, paper, and envelopes.  We appreciate your patience thru this period and apologize for any confusion this may have caused.
						</p>
						<p class="text-left">
							To expedite billing and prevent errors or returned mail from the postal service, we will be emailing invoices to all members who have provided us with email addresses.  While we realize that some people may like paper bills, we have had some returned recently as members did not alert us to a change in billing addresses.  We would like to prevent that in the future.  Billing by email is faster.  You can check on your account when you wish.  While we cannot take credit cards and mailing checks is still the way to go on payments, having an email address on file allows us to quickly email you a receipt for your payment so you aren’t wondering if we received it; if it was applied correctly; and what may be left it there is a balance.  We can, in addition, also email you statements and reminders detailing all your invoices, what quarter(s) they may be for, when they were due, the amount, etc.  For those who do not have an email address, we will mail you a paper receipt for all your payments.  Please give us a hand by updating us with your current email address as well as ensure future emails from ACC do not end up in your “SPAM” folders.
						</p>
						<p class="text-left">
							As an additional safety feature of our billing process, we scan copies of your checks with any documentation you may send with your payments.  Each member has their own file in ACC Homeowner Dues in which your scanned copies are transferred with the date we receive your payment.  If you aren’t sure of a payment sent, we can easily pull it up for you and give you a copy.

                        I found home in the Alpental valley in 2011, and I am blessed to build memories on the snow, trails, and around the table with my wife and children.  Surrounded by trees, mountains, family and friends, I am truly living my dream.  Whether it’s snowskating Alpental in the winter paddling a mountain lake in the summer, or picking huckleberries in the fall, I always find a way to get a smile on my face around here...

We love living up here full time so we can enjoy our mountain life. We go skiing and snowboarding whenever we can as we enjoy being on the hill.
