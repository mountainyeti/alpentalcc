									We are still hoping to get more people onboard with e-Billing however there appears to be glitches here and there in the QuickBooks Online Program.  The program does allow me to see if people have “viewed” their invoices, but it may not be reliable.  As we cannot be 100% certain each email invoice is reaching the paying recipient, we will continue to both email AND mail the billings.  If you are receiving your invoices and paying from those emails, please let me know if you do not need me to mail you a paper invoice.

									Reminder:  As an additional safety feature of our billing process, we scan copies of your checks with any documentation you may send with your payments.  Each member has their own file in ACC Homeowner Dues in which your scanned copies are transferred with the date we receive your payment.  If you are not sure of a payment sent, we can easily pull it up for you and give you a copy.

				<h4 class="info-title">Alpental Well Drilling Update</h4>
				<h5 class="description"></h5> 
				<h5 class="description"></h5> 
				<p class="text-center">
					An update on the well drilling.  It has gone slower than planed due to many reasons.  The contractor was back on track at the end of the day and plans to drill on Sat the 6th and complete the first 100’. Thank you for your patience and understanding to this activity and noise.
				</p>
				<p class="text-center">
					The goal is to find more water that is of good quality.  Currently the District can draw up to 400 gpm from the two wells that are currently in use.  The DOE permit allows a withdrawal of up to 600 gpm.  This increased production is needed to meet the current demand and to meet fire flow requirements.  The District has grown by 27% in the past six years and the obligated demand that the District is required to meet by the DOH is increasing. Being able to produce 600 gpm will ensure that the District meets current water demand and fire flow requirements.  The next goal is to find a higher quality of water.  The two wells that are in use have elevated levels of arsenic and occasionally are in violation of the EPA limits.  Thus if a better source can be found then the three wells can be blended to lower the level of arsenic being delivered. If not, the District is prepared to build a water treatment system to ensure the water quality meets EPA limits. Another goal is to develop a well that meets todays municipality standards.  This past summer we had the two wells that are currently in service tested and inspected with a video camera.  Many years ago these wells were developed for private use but now being used to serve the entire pass.  Thus it is time to develop a new well at todays standards and improve redundancy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Water is a vital source and the District is committed to completing multiple capital projects to ensure that the community is served properly.  If you have any questions you can reach out to Tom Hastings at THastings@snopass.org

                        Celebrating 7 years full time on the pass. Where does the time go? We’ve seen our daughter off to college and she’s returned home all grown up. We’ve gone through a few job changes but have found newer opportunities that have allowed us to grow. We’ve said goodbye to one of our dogs but will soon be welcoming a new puppy (or 2 or 3). We still love the snow more than the summer heat. While Jessie and I are embarking on a new family business together, Heather has been promoted to full time as the only field nurse for Washington state for her company. I am still a Commissioner for Snoqualmie Pass Utility District and am on my second trip through the Board here at Alpental Community Club while Heather still handles the bookkeeping. Helping our community is very important to us and I’m happy to be doing my part.

                         I look forward to serving as your Alpental Community HOA Secretary. I enjoy working with others and have experience recording meetings, coordinating projects and helping others work together effectively.  I have been a year around resident of Alpental for twenty years.  I enjoy our small community lifestyle and the beauty and challenges of our location and weather. As for winter sports, I prefer snowshoeing! Spring and Summer – I prefer spending time outdoors with neighbors talking, walking, hiking and gardening. I am particularly interested in the ecology of freshwater streams, wildflowers, wildlife and the geology of Alpental. It was always my desire to live in the mountains, near a forest and stream. I am lucky to have made my home in Alpental!

                        I’m the quiet one working behind the scenes with the ACC HOA bookkeeping.  When you see bills and reminders show up in your email or in your mailbox at home, you can bet I’m behind it.  We’ve made tremendous progress since taking this challenge on and I’m happy to report most folks have been a huge help getting the account ready for action whether it is snow removal in the winter or random repair work that needs to get done through the year.  Since taking this on my career has taken quite a turn and I am now the sole field nurse in Washington state for my company.  As such, my time doing billing will likely be a little tighter.  Just a reminder to all that it would save me time and money on supplies if we could get almost everyone accepting their billing, reminders, and receipts via email.  If you haven’t done so already, please email me with your correct email address(s) and let me know if “email only” is okay with you.
